		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>The idea for FamilyKTV was born from a love for music and family gatherings. Our founders, Lord Isaac Panganiban, grew up in a household where music was a cornerstone of every celebration. They realized that while there were many KTV options, few truly catered to families. With a vision to fill this gap, they set out to create a place where families could come together, sing their hearts out, and create lasting memories.</p>
